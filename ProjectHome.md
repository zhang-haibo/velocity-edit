**YOU ARE WELCOMED TO JOIN IN THIS PROJECT**

**INTRODUCTION**

VelocityEdit is based on Velocity Web Edit which has stopped updating since 2006 and is now incompatible with the latest Eclipse 3.7.2. So I build this to make it go on.
PS: Actually I prefer not to start another project but I can't contact with the original author. If you know his email address or something alike, contact me~

Since Version 1.5 I began to add features on my own will. Below is the killing features you can only enjoy in my velocity-edit version~

**Word Completion**
