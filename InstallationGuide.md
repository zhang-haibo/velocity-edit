1. Just drop the jar package into the "dropins" folder of your Eclipse base directory.
2. Done.

**NOTE**
if you want to use macro completion. you shall config it in "Window->Preference->Velocity Web Edit->Macro Template Path". The path is the path related to your projects. For example, if my macro files are located in "my-web-project/src/templates" directory, I should fill in "/src/templates"
